### Sublime Tmpl
Custom file template

The most common case we may see the application of template is DTD in html. For example, we need to type dtd tags for every html5 page like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

With template file, every time we create a .html file in sublime, it generate the dtd declaration for us, this is very usefull.

Currently, SublimeTmpl plugin supports six file types: html、css、javascript、php、python、ruby, all template files are stored in plugin's template directory, and we can cutomize them as we need.

Shortcuts:

- `ctrl+alt+h` html
- `ctrl+alt+j` javascript
- `ctrl+alt+c` css
- `ctrl+alt+p` php
- `ctrl+alt+r` ruby
- `ctrl+alt+shift+p` python

If we want to support more file types, we can define template files in plugins template directory, then we open these four file:

- Default (Windows).sublime-keymap
- Default.sublime-commands
- Main.sublime-menu
- SublimeTmpl.sublime-settings

then we modify them accordingly.
